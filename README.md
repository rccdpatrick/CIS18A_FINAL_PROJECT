# CIS18A_FINAL_PROJECT

Thsi project is a test of my comprehension in what I learned in Java CIS18A and my ability to reproduce that into one program. My name is Patrick S and I created a retaurant program that will take a certain ingredient such as a fruit or vegetable, take it's weight, then output the calorie amount of that said ingredient. Currently the program is in version 1 meaning that there its useability is not at its best. However with time and effort, it can be trimmed and made more optimized and user friendly. To use the program is fairly simple. A prompt will appear with the instructions as such: 

Hello, this program is a demo that will assist you in calculating how many calories your meal will use. At the moment it will ask you to input the amount of grams of an ingredient to determine the amount of calories.

From there all you have to do is follow instructions and press enter to finalize and input your answer.
